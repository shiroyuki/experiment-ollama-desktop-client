# Ollama Desktop Client

> Juti's Experimental Project

## Motivation

1. Want to use an LLM locally.
2. Build a client which looks relatively stable/usable and not buggy.
3. Want to play to desktop software development tools/frameworks/libraries. :)

## How to run the app from the source code

1. Install Java 21 SDK.
2. Then, run this command:
   ```shell
   ./mvnw clean javafx:run
   ```

> If you are using an IDE, run the `MainApplication` class.
